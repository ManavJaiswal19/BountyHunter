Set port to 3307 for localhost server.
Then everything will work fine as port 3307 has been used.


otherwise:
	1-Go to "dbconfig->config.php" and change port to whatever port you are using.
	2-Also go to config.php in the main folder "BountyHunter" and change the port to whatever port you are using.
